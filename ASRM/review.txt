The key steps are:

1-Generate initial design of experiments (DoE) using quasi-Monte Carlo Sobol sequence
2-Evaluate simulator at each point
3-Train ANFIS surrogate model
4-Optimize surrogate model using genetic algorithm
5-Update DoE by adding new points around surrogate optimum
6-Retrain surrogate model
7-Repeat process for max iterations
8-The code uses some placeholder functions for the reservoir simulator, ANFIS model, and genetic algorithm. These would need to be replaced with actual implementations.

I included a simple quadratic objective function to demonstrate the approach. The key ASRM steps are implemented in the asrm() function.


Certainly, implementing a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for well placement optimization involves several steps. I'll provide a simplified example using the Q-learning algorithm. Keep in mind that the actual implementation may need to be tailored to the specific characteristics of the UNISIM case.
Please note that this is a basic example, and you would need to adapt and extend it to fit the specific details of the UNISIM-I-D well placement optimization case. Additionally, fine-tuning parameters, defining the state space, action space, and reward function, and integrating the RL agent with the reservoir simulator are critical steps that require a deeper understanding of the specific problem at hand.

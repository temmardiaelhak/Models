The key aspects:

1- Load UNISIM case and extract grid, properties and simulator interface
2- Define optimization constraints like distance from existing wells, grid bounds
3- Initialize ASRM optimizer with simulator, grid, constraints
4- Perform optimization and retrieve best location
5- Print solution and render well on grid
6- The unisim package handles loading data and interfacing with the simulator.

ASRM class encapsulates the adaptive optimization workflow.

Constraints like distance and bounds are defined separately for clarity.
